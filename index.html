          <h1>Welcome to Inizio</h1>

<p>Inizio is a wordpress theme starting point. It was originally built by <a href="https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones">eddiemachado</a>.
He did a great job with Bones, but I wanted it more stripped out, I wanted just the bones, no flesh.</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>I've provided you with some example files, be sure to check them out and read the comments. So let me walk you through the theme structure:</p>

<h3>Assets</h3>

<ul>
<li>assets/

<ul>
<li>css/

	<ul>
		<li>gfx/</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>js/
	<ul>
		<li>components/</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>img/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>admin/

<ul>
<li>css/

<ul>
<li>gfx/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>js/</li>
<li>img/</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>All sorts of assets are located in the <strong>assets</strong> folder, those are <strong>css</strong>, <strong>js</strong> and <strong>images</strong>.
I always use a sub-folder in the <strong>css</strong> directory called <strong>gfx</strong>. In this folder I store design related images, images that is used via <strong>background-image</strong>.
The reason I do this is to separate content images and design images. Content images should be in the <strong>img</strong> folder.
Last but not least we have the <strong>js</strong> files, no need to tell you where they should go. Javascript libraries goes into the <strong>components</strong> folder.</p>

<p>Note that you don't have to use this structure if you don't feel comfortable with it, feel free to setup your own, maybe also share your thoughts on this topics too.</p>

<h3>Helpers</h3>

<p>I call these helpers because they're not template files, these are files that provides extra functionality.
When you first look into this folder you will see there's already five files in there. The most important are <strong>inizio.php</strong> and <strong>initial.php</strong>.</p>

<h4>inizio.php and initial.php</h4>

<p>inizio.php is the core class. It is a collection of useful function for you to use when you develop your theme. I will not go through all of them but check out <strong>functions.php</strong>, there's some examples and everything is well commented in the inizio.php file too.
initial.php is extended by inizio.php and is a collection of functions that cleans up wordpress a bit. These will autorun when you initiate Inizio.</p>

<h4>The other files</h4>

<p>I will make this quick. The other files is a custom post type helper with an example of how to use it and the other one is a widget helper. Check those files out and you'll learn more.</p>
