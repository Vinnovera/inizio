# Welcome to Inizio #

Inizio is a wordpress theme starting point. It was originally built by [eddiemachado](https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones).
He did a great job with Bones, but I wanted it more stripped out, I wanted just the bones, no flesh.

## Get started ##

I've provided you with some example files, be sure to check them out and read the comments. So let me walk you through the theme structure:

### Assets ###
* assets/
  * css/
    * css files
    * gfx/
    * admin/
      * gfx/
  * js/
    * libs/
  * img/
    * icons/
    
All sorts of assets is located in the __assets__ folder, those are __css__ and __js__ files and __images__.
I always uses a sub-folder in the __css__ directory called __gfx__. In this folder I store design related images, images that is used via __background-image__.
The reason I do this is to separate content images and design images. Content images should be in the __img__ folder.
Last but not least we have the __js__ files, no need to tell you where they should go. Javascript libraries goes into the __libs__ folder.

Note that you don't have to use this structure if you don't feel comfortable with it, feel free to setup your own, maybe also share your thoughts on this topics too.
